**BMI Calculator**

**Overview:**


The BMI Calculator is a simple Python project that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user’s height and weight.
It also categorizes the BMI result into ranges such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese.
This project is perfect for beginners learning Python basics like input handling, conditional statements, and simple calculations.



**Features:**
	•	Takes user input for weight (in kg) and height (in meters or cm).
  
	•	Calculates BMI using:
  
BMI = weight / (height × height)

	•	Classifies results into standard BMI categories.

	•	Handles invalid inputs (0 or negative numbers).
  
	•	Simple & beginner-friendly code.

  

**Technologies / Tools Used:**

	•	Python 3.x
  
	•	Any Python IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, IDLE, Jupyter Notebook)
  
	•	Command Line / Terminal for running the script



**How to Install & Run the Project**

his BMI Calculator is a simple, standalone Python script that requires no external libraries beyond the standard Python installation.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can verify this by opening your command line or terminal and typing:

python --version
# OR
python3 --version


If Python is not installed, download and install the latest version from the official Python website.

Installation & Setup

Create the Project File:

Open your chosen text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).

Create a new file and save it as bmi_calculator.py (or any name ending with .py).

Insert the Code:

Paste the complete Python code for the BMI Calculator into the newly created file.

Navigate to the Directory:

Open your command line or terminal application.

Use the cd (change directory) command to navigate to the folder where you saved bmi_calculator.py.

cd path/to/your/project/folder


Running the Script

Execute the File:

Run the script directly from the terminal using the Python interpreter:

python bmi_calculator.py
# OR, if the 'python' command refers to an older version:
python3 bmi_calculator.py


Follow the Prompts:

The calculator will start by asking you to enter your weight in kilograms (kg) and then your height in meters (m) or centimeters (cm), depending on the script's design.

View the Results:

The program will output your calculated BMI value and its corresponding classification (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese).



**Instructions for Testing:**

You can test the BMI Calculator by trying different sets of values:

Example tests:

	•	Test 1:
  
Weight = 50 kg, Height = 1.60 m

→ BMI around 19.5 (Normal)

	•	Test 2:
  
Weight = 80 kg, Height = 1.70 m

→ BMI around 27.6 (Overweight)

	•	Test 3:
  
Weight = 95 kg, Height = 1.65 m

→ BMI above 30 (Obese)

	•	Test 4 (Invalid Input):
  
Weight = -5 or Height = 0

→ Program should show an error message

	•	Test 5:
  
Enter height in cm (like 165)

→ Program should automatically convert it into meters
