BMI Calculator

📌 Overview


The BMI Calculator is a simple Python project that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user’s height and weight.
It also categorizes the BMI result into ranges such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese.
This project is perfect for beginners learning Python basics like input handling, conditional statements, and simple calculations.



✨ Features

	•	Takes user input for weight (in kg) and height (in meters or cm).
  
	•	Calculates BMI using:
  
BMI = weight / (height × height)

	•	Classifies results into standard BMI categories.

	•	Handles invalid inputs (0 or negative numbers).
  
	•	Simple & beginner-friendly code.

  

🛠 Technologies / Tools Used

	•	Python 3.x
  
	•	Any Python IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, IDLE, Jupyter Notebook)
  
	•	Command Line / Terminal for running the script



📥 How to Install & Run the Project














🧪 Instructions for Testing

You can test the BMI Calculator by trying different sets of values:

Example tests:

	•	Test 1:
  
Weight = 50 kg, Height = 1.60 m

→ BMI around 19.5 (Normal)

	•	Test 2:
  
Weight = 80 kg, Height = 1.70 m

→ BMI around 27.6 (Overweight)

	•	Test 3:
  
Weight = 95 kg, Height = 1.65 m

→ BMI above 30 (Obese)

	•	Test 4 (Invalid Input):
  
Weight = -5 or Height = 0

→ Program should show an error message

	•	Test 5:
  
Enter height in cm (like 165)

→ Program should automatically convert it into meters
