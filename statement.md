**Problem Statement:**


People often want to check whether their weight is in a healthy range, but they don’t always have a quick way to calculate it.
BMI (Body Mass Index) is a simple method that helps in getting an idea about body weight based on height and weight.
This project aims to create a basic Python program that calculates BMI and tells the user in which category they fall.



**Scope of the Project:**
This project covers only the basic functionality of a BMI calculator.

It includes:


	•	Taking the user’s height and weight as input
  
	•	Calculating BMI using the standard formula
  
	•	Displaying whether the user is underweight, normal, overweight or obese

The project does not include advanced health analysis or storing data. The goal is to keep it simple and easy to run for anyone learning Python.



**Target Users:**

The BMI Calculator is mainly for:

	•	Students learning Python
  
	•	Beginners who want to build a simple project
  
	•	Anyone who wants to quickly check their BMI without using online tools

It is meant to be simple, so it can be used by anyone with basic computer knowledge.



**High-Level Features:**


	•	User can enter height in meters or centimeters
  
	•	BMI is calculated automatically
  
	•	The program gives the BMI category clearly
  
	•	Basic input validation is included to avoid wrong values
  
	•	Easy to run on any system with Python installed
